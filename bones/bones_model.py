# Okay, new containers!
# A `Character` contains `CharacterJoint`s; These are the basic unit of
# animation. Like nodes in a scene graph, they form a tree structure and
# have a transformation that moves / rotates them relative to their
# parent. These joints can be exposed to attach NodePaths to them, or
# controlled to move them around like NodePaths.
# There are further details to the `Character` which we will skip for
# now.
# At the other end of the animation system are the vertices that are
# moved around when joints move.  The vertex table contains a column
# that tells what row of the `TransformBlendTable` to use for this
# vertex row. Each row of that table contains a `TransformBlend`, which
# is a weighted list of `JointVertexTransforms`, which each reference a
# `CharacterJoint`. So each time that a model is animated, its joints
# get moved around, these movements are weighted and averaged, and then
# vertices get moved around accordingly.
# Now, the details of `Character` that we skipped.
